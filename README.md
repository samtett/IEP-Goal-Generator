# IEP Transition Goal Generator

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for generating IDEA-compliant IEP transition goals for students with disabilities, aligned with industry standards and educational frameworks.

## Overview

This system assists special education professionals in creating comprehensive, measurable IEP transition goals by:
- Retrieving relevant career information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook
- Aligning goals with educational standards (21st Century Skills, employability frameworks)
- Generating legally compliant postsecondary goals and objectives
- Providing evidence-based alignment with industry requirements

## Features

- **Smart Retrieval**: RAG pipeline using FAISS vector search and sentence transformers
- **Standards Alignment**: Automatic alignment with Iowa 21st Century Skills and IDEA 2004 requirements
- **Career-Focused**: Integration with BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook for current job market data
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit web application with intuitive input forms
- **Customizable**: Adjustable generation parameters and refinement options
- **Export Ready**: Download generated goals in text format

##  Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Internet connection (for initial data collection)

##  Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
https://github.com/samtett/IEP-Goal-Generator.git
cd /path/to/NLP
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
```

##  Data Collection & Setup

### Step 1: Collect Data

Run the data collection script to scrape BLS data and build the knowledge base:

```bash
python src/data_collection.py
```

This will:
- Scrape occupation data from the BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook
- Load educational standards (Iowa 21st Century Skills, IDEA requirements)
- Compile sample IEP goals
- Save everything to `data/knowledge_base.pkl`

**Note**: This step may take 5-10 minutes depending on your internet connection.

### Step 2: Build Vector Index

Build the FAISS vector index for retrieval:

```bash
python src/rag_pipeline.py
```

This will:
- Generate embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Build FAISS index for semantic search
- Save index to `data/iep_faiss.index` and metadata to `data/iep_metadata.pkl`

##  Usage

### Running the Application

Start the Streamlit web interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the Interface

1. **Enter Student Information** (left sidebar):
   - Student name, age, and grade
   - Career interests (e.g., "retail sales", "food service")
   - Assessment results (e.g., O*Net Interest Profiler scores)
   - Additional notes

2. **Optional: Use Sample Data**:
   - Check "Use Sample Data (Clarence)" to load the example case study

3. **Preview Retrieved Context** (optional):
   - Click to see what information the system retrieves for the student

4. **Configure Settings**:
   - Enter OpenAI API key (or set in `.env`)
   - Choose model (GPT-4 recommended for best quality)
   - Adjust creativity/temperature

5. **Generate Goals**:
   - Click "Generate IEP Goals"
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for generation
   - Review generated goals organized by category

6. **Refine Goals** (optional):
   - Provide feedback for refinement
   - Generate revised version

7. **Download**:
   - Click "Download Goals as Text" to save

### Sample Case: Clarence

The system includes a pre-loaded example:

**Student Profile:**
- Name: Clarence
- Age: 15, Grade 10
- Interests: Retail sales, working at Walmart
- Assessment: Strong in Enterprising (O*Net)

**Expected Output:**
- Postsecondary employment goal (e.g., full-time retail position at Walmart)
- Postsecondary training goal (on-the-job training, customer service workshops)
- Annual IEP objective (workplace communication and customer service skills)
- 3-4 short-term objectives with measurable criteria
- Alignment with BLS standards and 21st Century Skills
